Since the Launch of customized services and our open knowledge exchange in late 2017, many individuals and organizations have submitted bugs, asked questions, and proposed features via email. 

While we love email, this is not always the most suitable medium for discussion. Now, Thanks to a suggestion from our growing community, we have created a public Slack Team that anyone can join.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<a class="button" href="https://join.slack.com/t/redcell-ai/shared_invite/enQtMzE0MDUwMjI5NDk1LWQ4ZTYzN2IxY2Q4NzQ4MzQ1Y2Q0MTQ0NmJhZjJmZjMzMjdkMWNmMWU5ODE2ZTA2Mzc5ZGQ0Mjk0MTM5ZWU5Y2U">Join Redcell on Slack</a>
</p>

So, head on over, introduce yourself, and join in on the discussion. 

See you there!
