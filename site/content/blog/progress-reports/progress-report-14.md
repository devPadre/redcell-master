November marked the **one-year anniversary of the Insomnia Plus plan**. I can't even believe 
it's only taken a year for Insomnia to grow from a side project into a healthy business. Every
day still feels like a dream.

## Metrics Overview

It's amazing that growth numbers are still in the double-digits this late in the game. I 
thought for sure things would have started trending downwards by now. 

| Metric                     | Value This Month | Change    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Active App Users           | 58,336           | +22%      |        
| New App Users              | 17,396           | -2%       |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue  | $2713            | +15%      |
| Recognized Revenue         | $4375            | +41%      |
| New Trial Customers        | 554              | -4%       |
| New Paying Customers       | 47               | +7%       |
| Subscription Churn         | $59              | -21%      |
| Subscription Cancellations | 12               | 0%        |

These numbers aren't 100% accurate, though. A change to analytics tracking caused
some users to be double-counted near the end of the month, and three teams were deleted 
that were previously used for testing purposes. This means that the user spike near the end 
of the month is likely artificial and the MRR number should be around $200 higher. Thankfully, 
these errors shouldn't affect next month's numbers.

Well that's it for November! I plan on taking some much-needed time off in December 
so enjoy the holidays and I'll see you next year!

_P.S. I also plan on doing a year-end review in early January so if there's anything specific
you want me to cover, leave a comment below or shoot me an email and I'll try to include it._
