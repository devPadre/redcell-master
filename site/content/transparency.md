One of the goals when starting Redcell was to share as much about the process as possible. 
The first step towards that goal was publishing a monthly transparency report outlining growth, mistakes, successes, and general thoughts. 

This page is the
next attempt at sharing even more. It's fairly basic right now, but we plan to add more numbers
here as time goes on. If you have any suggestions for things you want to see, just 
[send an email](/support/) and let us know.
