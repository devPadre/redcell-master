<p>Like the technical community as a whole, the Redcell community is made up of a mixture
of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the
mission – including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.</p>

<p>Diversity is a huge priority, but it can also lead to communication issues and
unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This
code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.</p>

<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit
in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical
communities in which we participate.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Redcell project, including Slack,
the issue tracker, and any other forums created for the project which the community uses
for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect
a person&rsquo;s ability to participate within them.</p>

<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by
emailing <a href="mailto:contact@redcell.ai">contact@redcell.ai</a>. For more details
please see our Reporting Guidelines</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all
backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic
class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues,
and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember
that we&rsquo;re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone
else&rsquo;s primary language.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration
now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Redcell community should be respectful
when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Redcell community.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of professionals,
and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put
down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren&rsquo;t acceptable.
This includes, but is not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people&rsquo;s personally identifying information (&ldquo;doxing&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical,
happen all the time and Redcell is no exception. It is important that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The
strength of Redcell comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds.
Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human
to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve
issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
</ul>
